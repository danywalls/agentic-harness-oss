/**
 * PipelineRouter — routes issues to stations based on pipeline configuration.
 *
 * Instead of hardcoded station iteration (the old runner.ts approach), the router:
 *   1. Collects all active labels across all configured pipelines
 *   2. Fetches issues for each label via GitHub
 *   3. Detects which pipeline/stage each issue belongs to
 *   4. Checks concurrency limits and lock state
 *   5. Calls station.shouldProcess() to run station-specific gates
 *   6. Calls station.buildTask() to build the agent task
 *   7. Spawns the agent via spawnAgent()
 *
 * Adding a new pipeline = edit pipelines.json. No code changes here.
