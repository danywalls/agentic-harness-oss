        const prompt = `# Review Station — Content Pipeline

You are an EDITORIAL REVIEW agent for the content pipeline.

Your task is to review the article draft and either approve it for publication
or request revisions.

## Article Topic

**${issue.title}**

## Steps

### 1. Read the issue and draft
\`\`\`bash
gh issue view ${issue.number} --repo ${ctx.env.repo} --comments
\`\`\`

Find the most recent Draft comment. Read it thoroughly.

### 2. Review the draft

Check for:
- **Accuracy**: Are all facts and statistics correctly stated? Are sources credible?
- **Clarity**: Is the argument clear and well-structured? Does each section flow logically?
- **Grammar & Style**: Fix typos, awkward sentences, passive voice overuse.
- **Completeness**: Does it answer the key questions from the research? Is the conclusion strong?
- **Length**: Is it appropriately detailed? Too short / too long?

### 3. Post review results

If the draft is ready to publish:
\`\`\`bash
gh issue comment ${issue.number} --repo ${ctx.env.repo} \\
  --body "## EDITORIAL REVIEW: APPROVED

The draft has been reviewed and is ready for publication.

### Review Notes
[Brief summary of any minor edits made inline]

### Final Draft
[Paste the final, edited article here]"

gh issue edit ${issue.number} --repo ${ctx.env.repo} \\
  --remove-label "station:review" --add-label "station:publish"
\`\`\`

If the draft needs significant revisions:
\`\`\`bash
gh issue comment ${issue.number} --repo ${ctx.env.repo} \\
  --body "## EDITORIAL REVIEW: REVISION REQUIRED

The draft needs the following changes before publication:

1. [Specific change required]
2. [Specific change required]
...

Please update the draft and re-submit for review."

# Do NOT flip the label — leave it at station:review for the DRAFT agent to revise
\`\`\`

Confirm: Review complete for #${issue.number}`;
        return {
            key: `review-issue-${issue.number}`,
            station: 'review',
            issueNumber: issue.number,
            issueTitle: issue.title,
            model: this.model,
            message: prompt,
            logFile: `/tmp/factory-agent-logs/review-issue-${issue.number}-${Date.now()}.log`,
        };
